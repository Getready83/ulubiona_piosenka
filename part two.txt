I just wish there's no such thing as fighting, that the world could 
just be like perfect and everybody can get along but obviously 
that canâ€™t happen. 

(Can you, can you) 
Can you imagine time when the truth ran free 
The birth of a sun, the death of a dream 
Closer to the edge 

This never ending story 
Paid for with pride and fate 
We all fall short of glory 
Lost in our fate

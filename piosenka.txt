Takes more than combat gear to make a man 
Takes more than a licence for a gun 
Confront your enemies, avoid them when you can 
A gentleman will walk but never run 

If "Manners maketh man", as someone said 
Then he's the hero of the day 
It takes a man to suffer ignorance and smile 

Be yourself no matter what they say (x3) 

Whoa, I'm an alien, I'm a legal alien 
I'm an Englishman in New York 
Whoa, I'm an alien, I'm a legal alien 
I'm an Englishman in New York

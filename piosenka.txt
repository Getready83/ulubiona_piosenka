No I'm not saying I'm sorry 
One day maybe we'll meet again 
No I'm not saying I'm sorry 
One day maybe we'll meet again 
NO, NO, NO, NO! 

(NO, NO, NO, NO!) I will never forget 
(NO, NO!) I will never regret 
(NO, NO!) I will live my life 

(NO, NO, NO, NO!) I will never forget 
(NO, NO!) I will never regret 
(NO, NO!) I will live my life 

No I'm not saying I'm sorry 
One day maybe we'll meet again (NO, NO!) 
No I'm not saying I'm sorry 
One day maybe we'll meet again (NO, NO, NO, NO!) 

Closer to the edge 
Closer to the edge 
NO, NO, NO, NO! 

Closer to the edge 
Closer to the edge 
NO, NO, NO, NO! 

Closer to the edge 

Everyone's just going crazy in these days. 
It's like the end of the world. 

If you make a promise to yourself, 
you have to keep it no matter what. 

Some people believe in god, I believe in music. 
You know, some people pray, I turn up the radio. 

Music makes the world go round, and for me, 
if it wasn't around right now, I wouldn't be around right now. 
Music is everything to me. That's all I can say.

If "Manners maketh man", as someone said 
Then he's the hero of the day 
It takes a man to suffer ignorance and smile 
Be yourself no matter what they say 

Whoa, I'm an alien, I'm a legal alien 
I'm an Englishman in New York 
Whoa, I'm an alien, I'm a legal alien 
I'm an Englishman in New York 

Modesty, propriety can lead to notoriety 
You could end up as the only one 
Gentleness, sobriety are rare in this society 
At night a candle's brighter than the sun 

Takes more than combat gear to make a man 
Takes more than a licence for a gun 
Confront your enemies, avoid them when you can 
A gentleman will walk but never run 

If "Manners maketh man", as someone said 
Then he's the hero of the day 
It takes a man to suffer ignorance and smile 

Be yourself no matter what they say (x3) 

Whoa, I'm an alien, I'm a legal alien 
I'm an Englishman in New York 
Whoa, I'm an alien, I'm a legal alien 
I'm an Englishman in New York

Everyone's just going crazy in these days. 
It's like the end of the world. 

If you make a promise to yourself, 
you have to keep it no matter what. 

Some people believe in god, I believe in music. 
You know, some people pray, I turn up the radio. 

Music makes the world go round, and for me, 
if it wasn't around right now, I wouldn't be around right now. 
Music is everything to me. That's all I can say.

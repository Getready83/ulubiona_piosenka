Closer to the edge

There are so many moments you can share with anyone,
someone and you just feel like that moment will last forever,
when it’s only a night, it's only a moment. 

Fate has it's tricky ways of throwing something in front of you 
that you never expected. 

My philosophy in life is don’t regret anything you do, 'cause in 
the end it makes you who you are. 

I don't remember one moment I tried to forget 
I lost myself 
Is it better not said? 

Now I'm closer to the edge 
It was a thousand to one and a million to two 
Time to go down in flames and I'm taking you 
Closer to the edge 

No I'm not saying I'm sorry 
One day maybe we'll meet again
No I'm not saying I'm sorry 
One day maybe we'll meet again 
NO, NO, NO, NO! 

I just wish there's no such thing as fighting, that the world could 
just be like perfect and everybody can get along but obviously 
that can’t happen. 

(Can you, can you) 
Can you imagine time when the truth ran free 
The birth of a sun, the death of a dream 
Closer to the edge 

This never ending story 
Paid for with pride and fate 
We all fall short of glory 
Lost in our fate 

No I'm not saying I'm sorry 
One day maybe we'll meet again 
No I'm not saying I'm sorry 
One day maybe we'll meet again 
NO, NO, NO, NO! 

(NO, NO, NO, NO!) I will never forget 
(NO, NO!) I will never regret 
(NO, NO!) I will live my life 

(NO, NO, NO, NO!) I will never forget 
(NO, NO!) I will never regret 
(NO, NO!) I will live my life 

No I'm not saying I'm sorry 
One day maybe we'll meet again (NO, NO!) 
No I'm not saying I'm sorry 
One day maybe we'll meet again (NO, NO, NO, NO!) 

Closer to the edge 
Closer to the edge 
NO, NO, NO, NO! 

Closer to the edge 
Closer to the edge 
NO, NO, NO, NO! 

Closer to the edge 

Everyone's just going crazy in these days. 
It's like the end of the world. 

If you make a promise to yourself, 
you have to keep it no matter what. 

Some people believe in god, I believe in music. 
You know, some people pray, I turn up the radio. 

Music makes the world go round, and for me, 
if it wasn't around right now, I wouldn't be around right now. 
Music is everything to me. That's all I can say.

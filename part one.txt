There are so many moments you can share with anyone,
someone and you just feel like that moment will last forever,
when it’s only a night, it's only a moment. 

Fate has it's tricky ways of throwing something in front of you 
that you never expected. 

My philosophy in life is don’t regret anything you do, 'cause in 
the end it makes you who you are. 

I don't remember one moment I tried to forget 
I lost myself 
Is it better not said?
